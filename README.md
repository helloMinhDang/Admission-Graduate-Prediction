# Graduate Admission Prediction

## Dataset Source
The dataset used in this project is taken from [Kaggle: Graduate Admissions](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohansacharya/graduate-admissions/data?select=Admission_Predict_Ver1.1.csv).  
It contains information such as GRE Score, TOEFL Score, University Rating, SOP, LOR, CGPA, and Research experience, with the target variable being **Chance of Admit**.

## Applied Algorithms
In this project, several machine learning algorithms were implemented and compared to predict the probability of admission:

1. **Simple Linear Regression**  
2. **Multiple Linear Regression**  
3. **Polynomial Regression**  
4. **Ridge Regression**  
5. **Lasso Regression**  
6. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Regression**  
7. **Decision Tree Regression**  
8. **Ensemble Methods** 
9. **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**  
10. **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) Regression**

The notebook includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, evaluation, and comparison across these methods.
